# AODV Evaluation on Android

This is an Android application that uses Google's Nearby Connections API to realize the Ad Hoc On-Demand Vector (AODV) protocol.
The application can also integrate non-Android devices into the MANET via UDP.
This application forms the basis of an evaluation of AODV and its possible application on the Android platform.
If you are interested in a concrete application of AODV in Android, see this repository's upstream fork:
[AODV](https://github.com/jrodal98/connected-crossroad).

### Using the Application

This application must run on a physical Android device, as it uses networking features which cannot be emulated.

### AODV Routing

Details about the AODV routing algorithm can be found in [RFC 3561](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3561).
